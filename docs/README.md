# Device Activity Tracker Docs

**Status:** experimental. This project is a research proof-of-concept that demonstrates how message delivery side channels can reveal user presence. Operating it without informed consent can be illegal, unethical, and unsafe. Do not run against accounts you do not own or administer with explicit permission.

## Documents
- [security-risks.md](security-risks.md) — why this is a security and privacy hazard
- [legal-ethics.md](legal-ethics.md) — consent, lawful basis, acceptable use
- [deployment-notes.md](deployment-notes.md) — operational cautions if you still choose to run it

If you are unsure whether you may use this tool: **do not use it.**
